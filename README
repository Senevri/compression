My "do it yourself" C compression project. 
Educational.

CURRENT ISSUES:
- something glitchy about RLE - OS specific.
- Dictionary: dictionary.c's 'swap' function, or rather slow_sort, 
  seems to be losing quite a few dictionary entries. probable cause 
  is setting keyword list node's 'next' to 0, when it shouldn't.
